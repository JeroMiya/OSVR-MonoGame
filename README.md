# OSVR-MonoGame
MonoGame adapters for Managed-OSVR.

WARNING: This repository is highly experimental and a work in progress.

To build, you will need a clone of Managed-OSVR at the same level as this repository, and you'll need to run the script to create the nuget package in Managed-OSVR. This will go away when Managed-OSVR becomes an official NuGet package.

## Requirements
You will need the OSVR-Core snapshot, version 0.2-10-g533610f (32-bit version). Run osvr-server from the bin folder of the snapshot, and then run the OSVR-MonoGame sample.
